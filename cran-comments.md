* The package is designed to be used on the [All of Us Researcher Workbench](https://www.researchallofus.org/data-tools/workbench/), which is a cloud-based platform for researchers to analyze data from the All of Us Research Program. The package is not intended to be used outside of this environment (and will not in general have any functionality). All examples and tests run successfully on the Workbench.

Note that the JAMIA publication link is intermittently not found by `url_checker`
but we have verified that it is correct. 

This is a minor release, v1.2.
