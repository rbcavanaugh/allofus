\title{Function to query allofus observation table for survey responses}
\usage{
aou_survey(
  cohort,
  questions,
  question_output = "text",
  clean_answers = TRUE,
  con = getOption("aou.default.con"),
  collect = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cohort}{tbl or dataframe with a cohort that includes a column called person_id}

\item{questions}{either a vector of concept_ids or concept_codes for questions to return results}

\item{question_output}{how to name the columns. Options include text format ("text"), as concept ids preceded by
"x_" ("concept_id"), or using a custom vector of column names matching the vector of `questions`. Defaults to "text".}

\item{clean_answers}{whether to clean the answers to the survey questions. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{con}{connection to the allofus SQL database. Defaults to getOption("aou.default.con"), which is created automatically with `aou_connect()`}

\item{collect}{whether to return the results as a local (TRUE) or database table}
}
\description{
Because responses to the survey questions stored in the ds_survey table do not
include skipped questions (i.e., missing data!), this function makes it easier to
query the observation table for responses to survey questions so that the skipped
responses are included.

The function will return a dataframe or SQL tbl with the initial cohort table along
with a column for each question included in `questions` and answers for
each person_id in the cells. The column names (questions) can
be returned as the concept_code or concept_id or by providing new column names. For each question, a column with
the suffix "_date" is included with the date on which the question was answered.
When questions can have multiple answers ("checkbox"-style questions), answers
are returned as a comma-separated string.

To find the desired survey questions, use the all of us data dictionary,
survey codebook, athena, data browser, or the allofus R package
modified codebook which can be found here: https://roux-ohdsi.github.io/allofus/articles/searchable_codebook.html
For questions regarding an individual's health history or family health history,
the function requires the specific concept_id (or concept_code) for individual in question,
whether that is "self" or another relative. Responses are returned as "Yes" if the respondent
answered that the individual had the condition, "No" if the respondent answered that the individual
did not have that condition (or omitted it when selecting from related conditions), a
skip response if the question was skipped, and NA if the respondent did not answer the question.
