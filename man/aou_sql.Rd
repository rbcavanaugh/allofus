\title{Execute a SQL query}
\usage{
aou_sql(query, CDR = getOption("aou.default.cdr"), collect = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{A SQL query (BigQuery dialect) to be executed. Interpreted
with `glue::glue()`, so expressions enclosed with braces will be evaluated.
References to `cdr` or `CDR` will be evaluated automatically.}

\item{CDR}{The name of the "curated data repository" that will be used in any
references of the form "{CDR}" or "{cdr}" in the query. Defaults to
getOption("aou.default.cdr"), which is Sys.getenv('WORKSPACE_CDR') if not specified otherwise
(the "mainline" CDR). On the controlled tier, specify the "base" CDR with
`CDR = paste0(Sys.getenv('WORKSPACE_CDR'), "_base")`.}

\item{collect}{Do you want to retrieve the result of the SQL query into
the local environment? Defaults to`TRUE`.}

\item{...}{All other arguments passed to `bigrquery::bq_table_download()`}
}
\value{
A dataframe (if `collect = TRUE`); otherwise, a `bq_table` object
}
